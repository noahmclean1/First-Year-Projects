# First-Year-Projects
Projects Completed in First-Year

Please contact me if you would like me to make these files private, as they are my personal work on class projects. 
 My intention is to show the work I have done and experience I have gained in my first year of classes, NOT to share or distribute answers.
 
# Fall Quarter Projects
All completed in Racket (running the 'main' function in each will activate the project, although they take in a few parameters)

 Cell Field is a fully functional and configurable pattern board. There are three colors. Clicking a cell will advance the color, 'a' will advance the entire field, and 'r' will reset them all to the base color.
 
 Chess Game is a complete chess game, in which the player plays both sides. All rules that I know of are implemented (including castling, pawn promotion, and en passant pawn movement). 
 
 # Spring Quarter Projects
 All completed in C (only MyShell is a standalone program, the other two are meant to run with grading software)
 
  Csim is a cache simulator. The csim.c file initializes a simulation of a computer cache, then trans.c utilizes different methods to optimize the transposal of different sized matrices to the virtual cache. 
  
  MyShell is a functional shell program that can execute user commands and the built-in commands 'cd', 'pwd', and 'exit'. It is also able to redirect outputs to a file. MyShell can use 'advanced redirection' which prepends the output of a call to the given file (uses >+ instead of >). 
   
  MM_Malloc is an implementation of the built-in malloc and free functions (as well as calloc and realloc). It does so through explicit free lists, first fit policy, as well as splitting and coalescing freed blocks.
